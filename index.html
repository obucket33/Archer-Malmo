	My trip to Archer Malmo was a blast I learned so much about how they work with different clients. They have a awesome office space with all type of retro vibes to it. I like the location downtown by the river is a very beautiful view to work at. They can bring dogs tow work which I think is a good thing because it makes it a friendly environment.It feels like almost working at home but at work doe. We learned about the pros and cons of working at Archer Malmo especially with working with big clients.

	There own time lines and have to get the product out to the customers at a certain time. Their websites they have made already are really awesome because of the designs and the skill they have put into it. They talked about how they all got into Archer Malmo and what made them get into computers and the jobs that there in. We discussed different ways t get into coding and art design.

	The building is really amazon because their 10 levels to it. It really makes you feel like your in New York with the office vibes. Their dogs were super friendly which is nice because then everybody can get along with each other. Their are not allowed to take any small business only business that offer half a million because of how big they've grown over the years.

	I think if you like computers or designing or coding websites this the job for you because of their friendless to others. There really cool people they really don't argue with each other. We learned about their film basement where they make their videos for companies. We learned about the curved wall and more. We learned how they get to work and basically start their day. Archer Malo has gotten great reviews so far but they do have a page where  if big companies where unhappy they can complain and fire somebody lol. If your looking for a job building company websites Archer Malmo is the place to by with their dog friendly policy and their friendly vibes its the place to be for people who are nice to others and love getting the job done.
